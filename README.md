# Tez
This purpose of this project is to  help data engineers quickly learn about Tez in a hands on way. We have provided detailed instructions on how to install and get started with Tez as well as some benchmarks that compare Tez with MapReduce.  

**This repository contains**:  
1) Instructions on Tez Installation and Set Up   
2) Tutorial Walk Through of running Hive on Tez   
3) Benchmarks comparing the Tez execution engine against MR  

**Systems**:  
*Hadoop 2.6.0, Hive 0.13.1, Tez 0.4.1*     
While it is possible that you can use later versions of these systems, this project has only been tested on the aforementioned systems. 

This project has been advised by the Duke University Computer Science department. Special thanks to Professor Shivnath Babu and PhD student Mayuresh Kunjir for their mentorship.
